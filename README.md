# Easy Dice
**Made for Habbo: Origins**

Roll/Reset your dice with a simple command. [GoEarth](https://github.com/xabbo/goearth)

Type ```:setup``` to assign your dice, or reset currently saved dice, while you are standing in your booth.
Now, when you type ```:roll``` or ```:close```, those five dice will do it in order you chose.

You may also use the command ```:tri``` to roll 3 dice in a triangle instead of all 5. This will automatically calculate the sum, and provide it in a client side message for you.

The extension is limited to sending packets every 500ms.
