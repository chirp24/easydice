# Easy Dice
**Made for Habbo: Origins**

Roll/Reset your dice with a simple command. [GoEarth](https://github.com/xabbo/goearth)

Type ```:setup``` to assign your dice, or reset currently saved dice. After using ```:setup```, roll/close the dice you want to save, in order.
Now, when you type ```:roll``` or ```:close```, those five dice will do it in order you chose.

```POKER``` results are auto-calculated by default, and send in a client side message. Other players cannot see these messages.

You may also use the command ```:tri``` to roll 3 dice in a triangle instead of all 5.

The extension is limited to sending packets every 500ms. This extension only serves the purpose of making your rolls/resets cleaner, and saving you the hassle of doing it for those hard to click dice.
